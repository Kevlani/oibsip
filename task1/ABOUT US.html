            <h3>JUNGLE SAFARI TOURS</h3>
            <p> India has a privilege to home a wide variety of natural flora and fauna. It's the home of one of the most majestic animals to walk on the face of this earth " TIGER "
                The most disheartening part is that, we have failed to understand and value it.
                The selfish need of man has brought this animal on the verge of extinction.<br>
                With only a few hundred of these mammals left in the wild, the tiger is fighting it's last battle for survival in the wild, and if this continues, the "Large Hearted Gentleman", as Jim Corbett called him, will survive only in books & story tales.
                Help this majestic animal fight its last battle for survival.<br>
                Understand the importance of it. And then let the day dawn, when you proudly show your child, one of the most magnificent animal on the face of this earth," TIGER"
