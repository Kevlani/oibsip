                    <p>
                        The feeling of intruding into someone else’s territory upon entering Gir National Park is rather pronounced. This is the land of the lions, crocodiles, hyenas and leopards. The flora here is incredible, with half the area of the park being covered by teak forest, amla, timru and khair, besides others. Of course, the Asiatic Lions are the lords here, and they are a spectacular sight. Apart from them, the other highly sighted spotter animal in the park is the Chital, or the Indian spotted deer. Striped hyenas and wild boars are other attractions. Here, one can also spot a fascinating variety of birds such as the Malabar whistling thrush to the Paradise flycatcher. Like the King of the Jungle, Gir is the kind of Indian jungle safari tours.

                    <h3>Pench National Park</h3>
                    <p>
                     The exploits of Mowgli and his friends in The Jungle Book fascinated us during our childhood. However, Rudyard Kipling based Mowgli’s adventures on this fascinating place. Located in the southern ranges of the Satpura range, it’s divided by Pendi River into two equal parts. A safari to this park lets you witness an exotic variety of wildlife including the Nilgai, Cheetal, Sambha and Gaur (Indian Bison). Another particular fascination of wildlife jungle safari in Pench is the four species of endangered vultures, namely the white-rumped, long billed vulture, white scavenger and king vulture.
